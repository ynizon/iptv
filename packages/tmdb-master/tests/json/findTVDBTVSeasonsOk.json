In Season 3, family and loyalty are the overarching themes as many critical storylines from the first two seasons come to a brutal head. Meanwhile, the Lannisters maintain their hold on King's Landing, though stirrings in the North threaten to alter the balance of power; Robb Stark, King of the North, faces a major calamity as he tries to build on his victories; a massive army of wildlings led by Mance Rayder march for the Wall; and Daenerys Targaryen--reunited with her dragons--attempts to raise an army in her quest for the Iron Throne.",
